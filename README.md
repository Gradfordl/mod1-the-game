https://github.com/Gradfordl/mod1-the-game || gradfordl.github.io

    You are a wizard setting off on a quest, presented with a myriad of options that will ultimately determine your fate! Make the right choices! 

##Requirements

    Two classes & one instance of each class
    Button controlled
    Flexbox
    Reset button
    
##Troubleshooting & FAQ 

    ###RESET BUTTON 
    
        I need to correct my reset button to where it takes you fully out of the game, to come back in, re-input name and start over. 
    ###ERROR HANDLING

        There are a few error handles I know I need to work in. When the game asks for user name input, I need an error handle to prevent it from moving forward if value is null. 
    ###CSS

        My CSS is not where I'd want it to be, but I wanted to focus on the functionality first. I planned on putting images in each of the story node objects to display when you reach each page, but I couldn't get it all to work before the deadline. 
    ###ATTACK

        I wanted to add actual attack functionality for the two villain instances. Ideally attack buttons populate and you can attack and defeat the villains through strategy. If that isn't possible, I wanted to see if I could have the computer randomly determine a winner or a loser. Maybe some Math.random/accuracy/attack functionality. 
    ###SATCHEL 

        I also want to add a button to where you can view which items are currently in your satchel! Just to give it a bit more interactivity.
